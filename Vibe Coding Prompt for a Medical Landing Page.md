# Vibe Coding Prompt for a Medical Landing Page

## Overview
Create a clean, modern, and professional landing page for a medical testing service. The design should be trustworthy and user-friendly, guiding visitors to learn about the services and easily book a test. The overall aesthetic should be similar to the website labhouse.vn.

## Design and Vibe
*   **Vibe:** Professional, trustworthy, clean, modern, and calming.
*   **Color Palette:** Use a predominantly white background with shades of teal and turquoise as primary colors. Use light grey for backgrounds of some sections and black for text. Specific hex codes to consider: #00A0A0 (teal), #F0F8FF (light blue/white), #333333 (dark grey for text).
*   **Typography:** Use a clean, sans-serif font like Lato or Montserrat for all text. Headings should be bold and larger than the body text. Ensure good readability with appropriate line spacing.
*   **Imagery:** Use high-quality, professional images of doctors, nurses, and medical equipment. The hero section should feature a large, welcoming image of a medical professional.
*   **Icons:** Use simple, line-art icons to illustrate services and steps in the process. Icons should be consistent in style and color (teal/turquoise).

## Layout and Structure

### 1. Header
*   A fixed header that stays at the top of the page on scroll.
*   Logo on the left.
*   Navigation menu on the right with links to "Services," "How it Works," "About Us," and "Contact."
*   A prominent "Book a Test" button on the far right of the header.

### 2. Hero Section
*   Full-width hero section with a large, high-quality image in the background.
*   A clear and concise headline in the center, such as "Reliable Medical Testing at Your Convenience."
*   A sub-headline that provides more context, like "Get accurate results from the comfort of your home."
*   A primary call-to-action button below the headlines, saying "Book a Test Now."

### 3. Services Section
*   A section with the heading "Our Popular Testing Packages."
*   A grid of cards, each representing a different testing package.
*   Each card should have an icon, the name of the package, and a short description.
*   A "View All Packages" button at the bottom of the section.

### 4. How It Works Section
*   A section with the heading "Four Simple Steps to Better Health."
*   A visual representation of a 4-step process, using icons and short descriptions for each step:
    1.  **Register:** "Sign up online and choose your test."
    2.  **Sample Collection:** "We'll send a professional to collect your sample at home."
    3.  **Get Results:** "Receive your results within 24-48 hours."
    4.  **Consultation:** "Our doctors will help you understand your results."

### 5. Why Choose Us Section
*   A section with the heading "Why Choose Our Service?"
*   A numbered list with 4-6 key benefits, each with an icon and a brief explanation.
*   Example benefits:
    *   "Certified and accredited labs."
    *   "Free at-home sample collection."
    *   "Secure and confidential results."
    *   "Expert medical consultation."

### 6. Call-to-Action Section
*   A full-width section with a contrasting background color (light grey or teal).
*   A large, centered headline like "Take Control of Your Health Today."
*   A prominent "Book a Test" button.

### 7. Footer
*   A comprehensive footer with a dark blue or dark grey background.
*   Four columns:
    *   **About Us:** A brief description of the company.
    *   **Quick Links:** Links to key pages on the site.
    *   **Contact Us:** Address, phone number, and email.
    *   **Follow Us:** Social media icons (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).
*   A bottom bar with copyright information and links to "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service."

## Interactivity and Animations
*   **Hover Effects:** Buttons and links should have subtle hover effects (e.g., a slight change in color or a shadow).
*   **Scroll Animations:** As the user scrolls down, elements should fade in or slide in gently.
*   **Responsive Design:** The website must be fully responsive and look great on all devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones). The navigation menu should collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile devices.
